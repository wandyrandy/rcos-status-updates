## Last Week's Accomplishments

> During this last week, I documented my evaluation of the Tic Tac Toe ReactJS tutorial. The evaluation can be found here in a google
> with everyone elses combined feedback:
> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zIV6gw4huFFn1ARIEYPIL2v9IWBSLxSD-ks7K-y3CZA/edit
> It's not a specific evaluation but just contains some pros and cons for the tutorial.

## This Week's Plan

> For this week, we plan on splitting up simple concepts (like variables, functions, conditional statements, or while/for loops
> in ReactJS and drafting small tutorials for these concepts.

## Anything Blocking?

> Nothing is blocking me now.
