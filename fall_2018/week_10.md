## Last Week's Accomplishments

> We presented our project at the large group meeting on Friday. I specifically talked about our project goals and how we are
> utilizing the feedback from the learning process that people of the curriculum team are giving to design better tutorials
> and curriculums for languages and frameworks that will branch off from one another.

## This Week's Plan

> RCOS is wrapping up for the semester, so I don't think I will be working on this anymore. I need to shift my focus to all
> my finals that are coming up and final projects that are due.

## Anything Blocking?

> Nothing is blocking me now.
