## Last Week's Accomplishments

> To be honest, I didn't put too much time to working on RCOS this week. I was busy studying for my Physics 1 test 2 which I was
> struggling with some of the material.

## This Week's Plan

> This week I'm going to finish the ReactJS tutorial on Tic Tac Toe. Then begin to document all the things that I learned from
> this tutorial and also the challenges I had in learning from this tutorial. 

## Anything Blocking?

> Nothing is blocking now since I finished my Physics test 2
