## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In the past week, I worked with the other people on the curriculum team on potential ideas for simpler ReactJS tutorials 
> that would then be able to branch off into more complex projects, but still have the same thread of concepts being taught in them.
> Some things we thought of were initially starting at a Tic Tac Toe tutorial, then branching out to either something like making 
> a connect four game, or chess or checkers.

> to make sure we present it well.

## Anything Blocking?

> Nothing is blocking me now.
