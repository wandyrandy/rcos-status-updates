## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Because I'm not familiar with JavaScript, I was working on a JavaScript tutorial off of CodeAcademy so I could better work on 
> the ReactJS tutorial and curriculum

## This Week's Plan

> This week we'll divide up tasks for making curriculums in ReactJS among the curriculum group. So I'll work on whatever topic is
> assigned to me

## Anything Blocking?

> JavaScript is still a bit unfamiliar to me, so I have to keep working through tutorials about that
