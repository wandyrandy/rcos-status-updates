## JavaScript Notes
Data is printed, or logged, to the console, a panel that displays
messages, with console.log()

Comments
- single line comments with //
- multi-line comments with /* and */

Data types
- 7 types: strings, numbers, booleans, null, undefined, symbolm
and object
- numbers can be both integers and floats
- strings can be in both double or single quotes (has to be consistent though)

Arithmetic operators
- include: +, -, *, /, %
- there are objects and methods. Performed by using the dot operator

3 ways to set variables:
1. var myName = 'Randy'

2. let myName = 'Randy'
- by using let, the variable can be easily reassigned
let myName = 'Randy';
console.log(myName); // Output: Randy
myName = 'Wang'
console.log(myName); // Output: Wang
- let variable can be assigned nothing, giving it a value undefined
let myName;
console.log(myName); // Output: undefined
myName = 'Randy';
console.log(myName); // Output: Randy

3. const myName = 'Randy'
- by using const, the variable cannot be reassigned because it is constant
- if const variable assignment is empty, it returns a syntax error
- if const variable is tried to reassign to a new valuable, it returns a
Type error

Numeric variable assignemnts can be changed with mathematical
assignment operators
- +=, -=, *=, /=
