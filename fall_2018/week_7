## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This past week, after I got my physics 1 test 2 out of the way, I completed the ReactJS Tic Tac Toe tutorial that we were tasked with.
> Doing a few tutorials in JavaScript before starting the React JS tutorial was really helpful in my understanding. I could comprehend
> most of what was going on in the code, compared to when I first attempted the tutorial and was just blindly adding code where the 
> tutorial told me.
> the code can be found at this github repo https://github.com/wandyrandy/RCOS-Learning-ReactJS

## This Week's Plan

> This week I plan on documenting everything that I learned and also evaluating the difficulties that I had with the tutorial and what
> was the most engaging and effective for learning parts of ReactJS. This information will then be used to begin designing the most optimal
> ReactJS curriculum for our project.

## Anything Blocking?

> Nothing is blocking now since I finished my Physics test 2
